# Quick Railway Deployment Fix

To fix the deployment error you're experiencing, follow these specific steps:

## 1. Root Directory Setting (MOST IMPORTANT)

When deploying on Railway:
- Click on Settings
- Set the **Root Directory** to: `lazyloadingtesting/server`
- This is case-sensitive and must be exact

## 2. Manual Environment Variables

Add these environment variables in Railway:
- `NIXPACKS_PKGS`: `dotnet-sdk_8`
- `PORT`: `8080`
- `ASPNETCORE_URLS`: `http://+:8080`

## 3. Additional Tips

- Delete the Railway service and create a new one if issues persist
- Make sure you're deploying from the GitHub repo, not Docker
- Try both deployment methods:
  1. Deploy with the "Nixpacks" option
  2. Deploy with the "Dockerfile" option

## 4. Verification

Your API should be available at:
- Health check: `https://[railway-url]/health`
- Products: `https://[railway-url]/products`

If you still encounter issues, run the debug.sh script on Railway.
